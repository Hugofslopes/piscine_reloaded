## Summary
<p>In this repository, you will find all the exercises I completed to finish the C Piscine at <b>42 School</b>.</p> 
<p>It was a really good experience and a very different way to learn. I came from a more 'standard' way of learning, like in college and university, where we have specific books to study from and teachers instructing us.</p> 
<p>It was great to discover that learning from the person next to you is also a really effective way to do it. Being constantly evaluated by others and explaining your code helps you learn a lot more about it.</p>
<p>Evaluating others also helps you a lot in learning a new subject or even discussing other ways to reach the same goal.</p>
