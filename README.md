## Summary
<p>In this repository, you will find all the exercises I completed to finish the C Piscine reloaded at <b>42 School</b>.</p> 
<p>Piscine Reloaded happened right before we started the common core and its goal was to review some of the exercises we had already completed while simultaneously learning about others that we were unable to do during the Piscine.</p>
